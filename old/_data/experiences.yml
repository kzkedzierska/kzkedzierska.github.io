  details: "I'm working with somatic mutations in various cancers and SNVs in different populations from 1000 Genomes Project for my thesis entitled 'Analysis of the mutational burden across gene sets in cancer'. I was one of the developer of SONiCS - tool for genotyping STRs from NGS data. I'm also collaborating on the project I was working on during my previous internship."

  time: July 2016 - June 2017
  company: Pemberton lab, Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology Departament @ UVa
  details: "I joined the project 'Epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer' in which I was responsible for both, sample processing and preparation for sequencing and analyzing data generated by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments. I gained more experience in sample processing techniques which I find advantageous in analyzing the data coming from high throughput sequencing."

  role: Research Assistant
  time: July 2015 - June 2016
  company: Laboratory of Zebrafish Developmental Genomics @ IIMCB in Warsaw
  details: "I joined the efforts of elucidating the gene regulatory network of zebrafish heart development using genomics. I was involved in both - gathering biological material, sample   processing and performing wet lab experiments together with data analysis. We applied RNA-seq  and ATAC-seq techniques to understand the heart development in zebrafish embryos."
